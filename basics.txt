REM <--- this is how comments work in Windows batch script files.

REM cd or chdir to change directories
cd Desktop
chdir C:\

REM use "." or ".." to refer to the current or parent directory, respectively
cd ..
cd .\Desktop

REM use no arguments just to print your current location, if you get lost
cd

REM list the current directory contents
dir

REM add "/A" to see hidden and protected files too
dir /A

REM use "help" to get a quick reference sheet
help dir

REM clear off your terminal with cls
cls

REM echo just returns what you give it
echo hello world

REM this is especially useful when combined with "redirection operators": ">" and ">>"
echo creates/overwrites a file! > NewOrOverwrittenFile.txt
echo appends to a file! >> Appending.log

REM paging output can be done with "more". Note the use of the "|" character to direct the output stream
echo "Some command that spits out a whole bunch of stuff" | more
